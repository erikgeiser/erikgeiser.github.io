My name is Erik Geiser and I'm a particle physics student that is interested in IT security. If you are interested in some of the CTFs I've solved you may also have a look at my [Hack The Box Profile](https://www.hackthebox.eu/profile/10166). While my focus lies in the realm of WebApp security, I also have some experience in binary exploitation and a great interest in any other subfield. My hobbies are programming, playing guitar, solving CTFs and obviously physics.

Currently I'm working as a Linux cluster administrator and full stack developer. In my free time I'm also involved in an open source workflow management project. Some of my work is accessible on my [GitHub Page](https://github.com/erikgeiser) and on the [RWTH Gitlab Page](https://git.rwth-aachen.de/erik.geiser). Unfortunately a lot of my work is also in publicly inaccessible repositories.
